General functions
=================
Space: FPS

C: Reset camera
K: General layout (unused)
1: Debug function

O: Debug, display distance between single selected node and hovered node

Performance adjustment functions
================================
L: Lower graphics quality to improve FPS
P: Skip real-time picking (mouse hovering) to improve FPS

Node, edge creation/deletion
============================
J: Create an edge between selected nodes and the hovered node
Delete: Deletes selected nodes/edges

N: Create new node under mouse cursor
	-The node will be placed on the plane intersecting the target point, also perpendicular to the camera

Definition: Target point
------------------------
-This non-fixed point is such that the camera always points exactly at the target point.
	Its distance to the camera is variable, and the camera's direction vector is parallel
	to the target point's position vector subtract the camera's position vector
-This point is useful for mouse interactions, as we could specify a plane that passes through
	this target point that is also perpendicular to the camera's direction vector


Varying distance between target point and camera
================================================
Mouse wheel up/down: Vary distance between camera and target point

Camera, target point movement
=============================
W/S: Move camera and target point up/down
A/D: Move camera and target point left/right
Q/E: Move camera and target point backward/forwards

Z: Roll camera clockwise
X: Roll camera counter-clockwise

Shift + Arrow Keys: Orbit camera around current target point
	-This moves the camera along the surface of a sphere with radius equal to the
	distance between the camera and the target point, centered at the target point

Arrow Keys: Turn camera
	-The camera itself will not move, the target point will move along the surface
	of a sphere centered at where the camera is

Node selection
--------------
-Hover the mouse cursor over an edge or node to cause it to turn BLUE.
-Click on an edge or node to select it, turning it GREEN.

Multiple selection
------------------
-Hold SHIFT and click on additional nodes/edges to select them.

Drag selection
--------------
-Drag the mouse cursor to create a selection rectangle, selecting all nodes/edges
	inside the rectangle upon mouse button release.

Mouse camera turning
--------------------
-Hold ALT and move the mouse cursor to turn the camera in a first-person like fashion.

Node drag movement
------------------
-Hold CTRL and drag the mouse cursor to move all currently selected nodes along
	the plane intersecting the target point, perpendicular to the camera. The
	nodes will move in the same direction as the mouse cursor.
